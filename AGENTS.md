This project generates a Typescript SDK for our API based on an OpenAPI spec in
`spec.json`.

All the code for the SDK is generated by scripts in the `src/` folder.

The SDK lives in the `src/api/` and `src/models` folders.

YOU CANNOT MANUALLY EDIT ANY FILES IN THE generated code folders.

EVERYTHING else is a generated file and you should instead update the generation
scripts, templates, and functions.

We aim to make this SDK as idiomatic to Typescript developers as possible.

We also try to write simple and idiomatic Typescript in the generation logic.

As you make changes run `yarn gen` to generate a new sdk and make sure you didn't break anything. And make sure `yarn tsc` still works as well.

If you make a breaking change add it to the CHANGELOG.md with a guide for users as to how to migrate.
